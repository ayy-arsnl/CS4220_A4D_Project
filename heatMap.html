        <h3> About </h3>
        <p>Our dataset contains information on AWS honeypots that have caught a botnet attempting 
            to infect them. This information includes the source's IP address, the date and time 
            of capture, the protocol being used, and precise information about each honeypot's 
            location. We have provided two different visualization styles for the data: a heatmap 
            of all captures from 3/3/2013 to 3/15/2013, and a detail map that shows each honeypot 
            individually. </p>
        <h3> Usage </h3>
        <p>To switch between the two views, find the button in the top left that says "Change 
            Map Style". </p>
            
        <p> On the heatmap, clusters are displayed on a color scale from blue to red, where blue 
            indicates a less dense cluster of honeypots and red indicates a high concentration 
            of honeypots. Click the magnifying glass icon to search for a specific location. Use 
            either the scroll wheel on your mouse or the +/- buttons on the map to zoom in and 
            out. If your map gets rotated, you can use the "Reset bearing to north" button 
            (button with arrows, directly under +/- button) to reset the rotation. </p>
            
        <p> On the detail map, each data point (honeypot) is displayed individually. The points 
            shown are filtered by date, so you will only see data points collected over a 
            timespan of one (particular) day at any given time. To select the day, find the 
            slider at the bottom and slide the dot to the day you would like to view. To see a 
            timelapse of each day, click the "play" button to the left of the slider, and to 
            stop the timelapse, click the stop button directly to the right of the play button. 
            Each point is color-coded depending on the protocol used for infection. A blue point 
            is TCP, an orange point is UDP, and a green point is ICMP. Additionally, you may 
            hover your mouse over any point on the map to reveal more information about that
            specific honeypot.</p>

      <h1>AWS Honeypot Heat Map</h1>
      <p> The map below is a geographic representation of the AWS(Amazon Web Services) Honeypot data set, ranging from March 2013 - September 2013.</p>
      <p> The heatmap provides a visualization of the areas with a high concentration of honeypot attacks. </p>
